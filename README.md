==================================================================
This is a modification of the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" from UCI Machine Learning Repository at 
"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones"



*The run_analysis.R script is an R script that takes the original data set from the UCI repository and creates a tidy data set.
 
*Codebook.md describes the data transformations performed on the original data sets by the script, and the structure of the newly created data set, XCleaned.csv

**Please read the important comment in the codebook regarding variable names used in the cleaned data set. I have deliberately re-used the original brilliant variable names with a slightly different meaning, in order to avoid introducing 66 new variable names.  


*XCleaned.csv is the cleaned "tidy" data set.
